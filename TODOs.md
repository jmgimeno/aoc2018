# TODOS

* day5
  * use collections.deque instead of lists

* day6
  * use numpy?

* day9
  * implement circular list
  * use method rotation in collections.deque

* day10
  * use numpy
  * use simpler function to minimize

* day11
  * optimize brute search

* day12
  * fix problem with periods longer than one by computing the state you'll get into when entering the last period fragment at the end

* day13
  * use also functions to model orientations (e.g, an orient function gives the position to next position in this orientation)
  * use translation and transformation matrices for operating on the positions

* day14:
  * improve the C++ solution to a more idiomatic code

* day15:
  * lot of refactoring is needed 

* day17
  * lot of refactoring is needed
  
* day19
  * implement a real factorization algorithm
  * enhance compilar to generate code as the hand-made cc program in day21
  
* day20
  * first parse regexp and then traverse it doing the exploration?
  
* day23
  * solve part2 as an optimization problem without using z3-solver
  * create a graph of nanobots with edges if two nanobots intersect, find the max-clique in that graph with Born-Kerbosch
